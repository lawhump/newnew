      Everything I do is with the goal of leaving this world better than I found it, creating a framework for substantial, lasting change that people will adopt generation after generation to come. I believe change starts from within, and to improve my environment I must always be growing.
      <br><br>
      I intend to achieve this by making my core values the foundation all work that I do:
      <br><br>
      Simplicity represents capturing and communicating the essence and adding no more. It’s saying only what needs to be said; it’s removing the distracting and leaving the necessary, it’s being intentional with less.
      <br><br>
      Equity is striving to leave this earth a better, fairer place than it was when I found it. It’s leveling the playing field and giving everyone a shot. It’s about giving everyone, regardless of birth country, class, race, gender, sexuality, or religion the opportunity to live a fulfilled life.
      <br><br>
      Sustainability is fostering a mindset concerned with scaling behaviors. It’s about repeatedly asking, “if everyone did [thing], would society thrive or collapse?” It’s about being cognizant of sharing this planet with billions of people and trillions more to come.
      <br><br>
      These principles guide me, and I have faith that, if adopted more broadly, existence as we know it would be a lot better. I hope this progress will be my legacy.
